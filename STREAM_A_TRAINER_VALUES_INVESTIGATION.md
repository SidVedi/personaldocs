# Stream A: Trainer Values Inconsistent — Investigation Summary

**Stream:** Stream A — Trainer Values Inconsistent  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Started:** 2026-02-16  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-18  

---

## Overview

User-reported inconsistencies in trainer feedback values (regret%, EV loss, feedback labels) between different views and sessions. Initial analysis identified 9 potential bugs spanning backend calculations, frontend fallbacks, and cross-version divergence.

**Investigation approach:**
1. Prioritize bugs by likelihood and impact
2. Conduct systematic testing with evidence collection
3. Document findings in bug-specific detail docs
4. Update this summary as investigation progresses

## Completed Investigations

### ✅ A-1: Range Array Divergence (V1 vs V2)

**Detail Doc:** [`A1_RANGE_DIVERGENCE_INVESTIGATION.md`](./A1_RANGE_DIVERGENCE_INVESTIGATION.md)

**Hypothesis:**  
V1 and V2 use different code paths to produce `range_array`, potentially causing divergent hand selection and strategy lookups.

**Investigation:**
- **Scope:** 11 test scenarios (7 V1, 4 V2) across Holdem + Omaha, multiple spots, sites, and research types
- **Method:** Debugger breakpoints at range decoding points, byte-for-byte comparison
- **Duration:** ~0.5 day investigation + ~1 hour defensive fix

**Findings:**
- ✅ Bug is **latent** (not actively triggering in production)
- ✅ No preflop tree nodes use sparse index compression (`indices` field)
- ✅ V1 and V2 produce **byte-for-byte identical** range arrays for all tested scenarios
- ✅ Bug would only activate if sparse compression is introduced in future

**Outcome:**
- **Status:** CLOSED (latent, defensively fixed)
- **Fix:** Added `expand_range()` call to V1/V3 endpoints (no-op when `indices` absent)
- **Tests:** 5 new unit tests added, all passing
- **Impact:** Zero — bug not causing reported inconsistencies

**Key Insight:**  
A-1 is ruled out as root cause. Investigation shifted focus to A-4 (frontend fallback) as likely culprit.

### ✅ A-3: Pot Size and Rake Divergence (V1 vs V2)

**Detail Doc:** [`A3_POT_SIZE_INVESTIGATION.md`](./A3_POT_SIZE_INVESTIGATION.md)

**Hypothesis:**  
V1 and V2 might use different strategy configs (standalone vs strategy-page), leading to different `rakeAfterEachStreet` flags and pot sizes, which would cause regret% to diverge.

**Investigation:**
- **Scope:** 4 test scenarios (V1/V2 × GGPoker/NoRake)
- **Method:** Debug logging of pot calculation pipeline, direct comparison
- **Duration:** ~1.5 hours (setup, testing, analysis)

**Findings:**
- ✅ V1 and V2 calculate **identical pot sizes** (5.0bb in all 4 tests)
- ✅ Both use the **same strategy object** via `get_matching_strategy()`
- ✅ Both use the **same pot calculation logic** (`adjust_pot_size_with_rake()`)
- ✅ No evidence of config source divergence
- ⚠️ All tests showed `rake_flag=False` (expected for preflop — rake not collected yet)

**Outcome:**
- **Status:** CLOSED (not a bug)
- **Fix:** None needed
- **Impact:** Zero — no divergence exists

**Key Insight:**  
Frontend `fromStrategiesConfig` is only used to pre-populate V2 request params, not as a separate config source. Both endpoints derive params from the same request and hit the same Redis cache.

### ✅ A-4: Frontend Regret Fallback Formula

**Detail Doc:** [`A4_REGRET_FALLBACK_INVESTIGATION.md`](../../GameTrainer-Frontend/docs/A4_REGRET_FALLBACK_INVESTIGATION.md)

**Hypothesis:**  
Frontend recalculated regret using a different formula than backend when values were missing, causing inconsistent feedback labels across views.

**Investigation:**
- **Scope:** 7 affected components (trainer, replayer, mobile)
- **Method:** Code analysis, PR #6144 implementation
- **Duration:** ~1 week (Feb 10-16, 2026)

**Findings:**
- ✅ **Formula divergence confirmed** — Frontend used simple EV loss, backend used weighted-EV regret
- ✅ Different formulas → different regret% → different feedback labels (optimal/strong/weak/blunder)
- ✅ Affected **all user sessions** (not just edge cases)
- ✅ Impact was widespread: trainer center panel, feedback panel, history list, replayer, mobile

**Formula Comparison:**
- **Backend (Correct):** `((best_EV - weighted_EV) / pot) * 100` — Accounts for mixed strategies
- **Frontend Fallback (Wrong):** `((best_EV - selected_EV) / pot) * 100` — Assumes pure strategies

**Outcome:**
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED (merged Feb 16, 2026, awaiting production deployment)
- **PR:** #6144 (18 files, +1375/-292 lines)
- **Fix:** 
  - Added `getRegretPercent()` utility for backend value validation
  - Removed all client-side regret calculations
  - Show em dash (—) when backend value is invalid instead of recalculating
  - Debug users see dual BE/FE display for comparison
- **Tests:** 3 new test files, +391 lines of tests
- **Impact:** HIGH — Expected to resolve most user-reported inconsistencies

**Key Insight:**  
A-4 is the **primary root cause** of user-reported inconsistencies. Different formulas affected every hand, while A-1 and A-3 were either latent or non-existent.

## Active/Pending Investigations

### ⏸️ A-2: EV Decode Precision Loss

**Status:** PENDING (deferred until A-4 validated)

**Hypothesis:**  
EV values decoded from float16 → float64 may lose precision, causing small rounding differences that compound in regret calculations.

**Plan:**
- Wait for A-4 fix deployment and validation
- If inconsistencies persist, investigate EV precision
- Compare EV values between V1/V2 at decode time

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Culprit: A-4 (Frontend Regret Fallback) ✅

**Evidence:**
1. Frontend uses fundamentally different formula than backend
2. Formula differences affect **every hand** (not just edge cases)
3. A-1 and A-3 ruled out (no backend divergence)
4. A-4 fix already implemented and ready for deployment

**Impact Chain:**
```
Frontend fallback formula differs from backend
→ Different regret% calculated
→ Different feedback labels (optimal/strong/weak/blunder)
→ User sees inconsistent feedback between views
```

### Contributing Factors (Possible)

- **A-2 (EV precision):** May cause small rounding differences
- **A-3 (Pot size):** Ruled out — no divergence
- **A-5–A-9:** Lower priority, investigate only if issues persist after A-4

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Evidence Collection
1. Add targeted debug logging
2. Run parallel tests (V1 vs V2, different sites)
3. Capture logs and API responses
4. Compare byte-for-byte

### Phase 2: Analysis
1. Identify divergence points (if any)
2. Trace code paths to root cause
3. Determine impact scope

### Phase 3: Fix & Validation
1. Implement fix (backend or frontend)
2. Add regression tests
3. Document findings
4. Deploy and monitor

- ✅ Multiple research types (full_tree, postflop_only, preflop_only)
- ✅ Range types (full, narrowed)
- ✅ V1 vs V2 direct comparison

### A-3 Testing
- ✅ 4 scenarios (V1/V2 × GGPoker/NoRake)
- ✅ Identical game parameters
- ✅ Pot calculation pipeline instrumented
- ✅ Rake flag and adjustment validated

### A-4 Testing
- ⏳ In progress
- Plan: Compare frontend vs backend regret values across multiple hands

## Lessons Learned

### Investigation Best Practices
1. **Start with evidence, not assumptions** — A-1 and A-3 hypotheses were logical but disproven by testing
2. **Instrument the code** — Debug logging revealed exact divergence points (or lack thereof)
3. **Test comprehensively** — Multiple scenarios across variants, sites, spots revealed patterns
4. **Document findings** — Detailed docs prevent re-investigation and inform future work

### Code Quality Insights
1. **V1 and V2 are more aligned than expected** — Both use shared helpers and same strategy lookup
2. **Frontend fallbacks are risky** — A-4 shows danger of client-side recalculation with different formulas
3. **Defensive fixes are valuable** — A-1's `expand_range()` protects against future data format changes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week of 2026-02-18)
1. ✅ Complete A-3 investigation (DONE)
2. ⏳ Validate A-4 fix in staging/dev environment
3. ⏳ Deploy A-4 fix to production
4. ⏳ Monitor user feedback for resolution confirmation

### Short-term (Following Week)
1. If issues persist after A-4: Investigate A-2 (EV precision)
2. If issues resolved: Close Stream A investigation
3. Document final root cause analysis

### Long-term
- Consider refactoring frontend to always trust backend values (no fallbacks)
- Add integration tests comparing V1/V2 responses
- Monitor for new inconsistency reports
